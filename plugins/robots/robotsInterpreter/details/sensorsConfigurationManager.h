/// (2d model, SensorsConfigurationWidget, preferences page), or contains them, inherits from
/// SensorsConfigurationProvider and connects to other providers and eventually to SensorsSettingsManager object
/// (by calling connectSensorsConfigurationProvider method).
///
/// Then any sensorConfigurationChanged calls are propagated through resulting network of interconnected
/// SensorsConfigurationProvider-s so they are kept in sync with each other.
/// SensorsConfigurationManager is a center of this network and is the one place which saves sensor settings
/// in a registry.
///
/// Initialization is also centralized, SensorsSettingsManager::refresh() shall be called after all clients are
/// connected and this will initialize everything.
